Learn da Guitr

## V 0.0.1
**MVP Description** - Users are able to open the app and view their character either happy or sad given how often the user has played. The user can view their streak and progress bar of the songs they are learning. Then they can start a new session for what song they are going to be practicing or what they are practicing in general. Could be song, scale, or something else. (Might need to have something where they can either select multiple things they want to work on or be able to switch what they work on or just have something at the end saying what they worked on). Below that they should have a view of each of the songs that they are learning. They can tap on a song and they are able to see how much progress they have made in the song and do other things like edit or delete the song if they want.

**Revenue streams** - currently I am thinking the main revenue stream will be skins/ customizations to the characters.

**Most important things with Claude Code**
- Claude.md
- MCP servers
    - unsure what servers so far
- \# to help memory
- 

### To-do
- look at duo lingo and try and base my app off it slightly
    - take some components from it like the buttons and stuff

Some prompts for after work
- please create a simple view of this (show screenshot of view gemini made) to allow users to start a session and save songs
- please implement the authentication
- will need to look into auth (check duo lingo as well)
- connect the db in supabase to the code in the project
